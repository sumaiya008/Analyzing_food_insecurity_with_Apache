# Analyzing_food_insecurity_with_Apache
This notebook aims to study the issue of food insecurity by examining the listed prices of various food items across different neighborhoods in New York City. The hypothesis is that individuals residing in areas with higher food insecurity will pay more for the same items compared to those in more secure areas. For this analysis, we will focus exclusively on food products from KeyFoods supermarkets, one of the top four supermarket leaders in Metro New York, according to the Food Trade News 2021 report.

This analysis will be conducted using Apache Spark, alongside Google Colab and Google Cloud Dataproc.
